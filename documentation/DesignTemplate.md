Today, I and @sojharo reviewed some design documents and found out that:

1. Every document format was different. 
2. Every document has different headings. 
3. Some documents were missing socket.io changes
4. Almost all documents were missing plan permissions and features modification
5. Some documents does not say about data compatibility.

We decided that there should be a proper design document format and everyone needs to follow the format while creating any new design document. Every design document must have following headings:

1. Purpose
2. Feature Explaination
3. Affected Modules
4. Plan Permission Modification
5. Plan Features Modification
6. Usage Table Modification
7. How the old data will be normalized?
8. Database Modification
9. Server Side Changes
10. Client Side Changes
11. Socket.io Changes
12. Tasks
