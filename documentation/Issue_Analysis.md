Team,

I have assigned all the bugs that have been opened now. Please don’t rush to fix the bug. I know most of them would be either one liner fix or little bit more. Feature is there, so we are just fixing bug and not rewriting it. Instead of just fixing the one liner issue and declaring victory, please do the analysis and come up with root cause. Here is the method you should work on any assigned bug:

1. Identify what broke the code?
2. Identify the commit and developer who is responsible for that change.
3. What is the way that we can ensure that this code doesn’t break again.
4. Don’t just blindly fix by doing the reverse of code that broke it. There must be some reason for writing of that code. Explain the reason before you put fix.

**Note:** I won’t accept the pull request if I don’t get answers to these questions before the fix.

Please Acknowledge.
